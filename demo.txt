What is your favorite movie?

My favourite movie is The Interview. 

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

If I could go anywhere in the world on holiday, I would go to the Bahamas.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

If I could have any superpower, I would gain the ability of flight. If I had this power, I would never be late and I would avoid paying for flights!
